Small stats library for JavaScript
==================================

I suck at math, so this thing could totally be wrong... therefore **I wouldn't recommend using it**. If you do and the numbers are actually correct, let me know so I can feel better about my self. I mainly did it because I wanted to re-factor some code I wrote for my math class, as well as learning more about *github, markdown, and javascript*.

Usage:
------

### Constructor

You can *construct* a new sample set in 2 ways:

1) pass in an array: stats = Stats.init([2,4,5,6,1,8]);

2) pass in a *comma delimited* string: stats = Stats.init("2,4,5,6,1,8");
